# TicTacToe
A simple game of TicTacToe, to play around with libGdx

## TODOs
Draw the crosses and circles in the board -- done -- except not, exactly, because I need to resize the Xs and Os to adjust to different screen sizes more elegantly.

Trap mouse clicks and update the board accordingly -- done

Main menu scene

Credits scene (vertical crawl of text)

Convert the Java code over to Kotlin (optional)

Try building/running it on Android -- done!

Try building/running it on iOS -- done! (Though I need to create a provisioning profile and put it onto a device yet.)

Try building/running it for web

Varying board sizes (which will require drawing the board from scratch or something, as well as calculating the click/touch areas dynamically based on the number of squares)

Provide an AI?
